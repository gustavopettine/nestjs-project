  Nestjs-project
</h1>

<p align="center">
  The Nestjs-project is software that utilizes the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), SOLID, and Clean Architecture, with the goal of creating a scalable and easily maintainable application. Structured in layers, the system clearly separates responsibilities between domain, application, and infrastructure, facilitating code comprehension and evolution. The implementation of SOLID principles ensures that each component is well-defined and loosely coupled, allowing for agile modifications and testing. The project includes robust features such as user management, authentication, and CRUD operations, all implemented with a strong focus on code quality and best engineering practices, providing a solid foundation for future extensions and maintenance.
